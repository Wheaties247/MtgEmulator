API to allow a user to search items by matching card text
Once a responce is returned and if a card is clicked you are linked to a page where you can add that specific card to your set of cards

### Users can manage the deck that their saved cards belong to on the Deck Management Page by clicking on the card that needs to have its deck information edited or deleted.

### Users can also create new decks to save cards to on the Deck Management Page

In order to implement the Magic the gathering deck constructor I used:

#### Spring-boot: bootstraps application (used as runtime)
#### Intellij Community edition - Intergrated Development Environment (used to complie Java code)
#### Axios - Used to preform XMLHttpRequests from React Client to 3rd party API and local server
#### React - Used to render Client side browser views
#### React-Router-Dom - Allows Specific routing to designated routes 
#### Docker - Used to encapsulate virtualization with application containerization is an OS-level virtualization method for deploying and running applications without launching an entire VM for each application
#### Gradle - Designed for multi-project builds; an open Source build automation system
#### Postgresql - Used to store persistant data from DB
